# Space Tourism

## About the project

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

For this challenge users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
